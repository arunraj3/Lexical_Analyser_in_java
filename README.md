# Lexical Analyzer using Java

A lexical analyzer is the first phase of a compiler. It takes modified source code from language preprocessors and breaks it into a series of tokens. The lexical analyzer removes any whitespace or comments in the source code.

The lexical analyzer converts a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. A token is the smallest entity of the code, it is either a: Keyword, Identifier, Constant, String literal, Symbol. 


The output of the lexical analyzer is a sequence of tokens that is sent to the parser for syntax analysis.
